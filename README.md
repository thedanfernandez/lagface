# Lag Face - The Game

"Lag Face" is an informal game played during online video conferences like Zoom, Teams, Meet, Skype, etc where attendees attempt to stay perfectly still and quiet to give the impression of new attendees joining the meeting that their video is laggy, frozen, or unresponsive - "I see you do you see me? I think my video is frozen as you all aren't moving..."

## Winning Lag Face

The last person to stay perfectly still is declared the winner. If you move or make sound, you are "out". See full rules below:

## LagFace Rules 

### Starting the Game

You can start Lag Face in three ways: 
1. **Beginning**: At the beginning of the meeting by joining the meeting and freezing in place. New meeting attendees get 1-2 seconds to realize "Lag Face" is being played and freeze in place for the next attendee.
2. **Late Attendee**: As new attendees join the call (say joining 10m after the meeting starts). All attendees can again freeze in place to start a new round of Lag Face. 
3. **Declaring Lag Face**: During a lul in a meeting, you can declare "LAG FACE!". Once this happens, all other attendees must instantly freeze in place. 

### Movement 

If you move any part of your onscreen body (head, body, hands, etc) or talk, laugh, cough, etc you are "out". Tapping your foot, if it's not shown onscreen, would be acceptable. 

### Environment 

Environmental motion or sound is fine. If there is background sound, if a family member walks by, or if a pet comes to say "hi" or gets in the way of your camera, you are still considered in the game, unless you move or make sound. 

### Blinking

Blinking is allowed by default. An *optional* rule for experienced Lag Face players is to **not** allow blinking which turns Lag Face into a staring contest. 

## Who created Lag Face? 
Lag Face started organically during meetings online video meetings with our Brian Peek, Clint Rutkas, and Dan Fernandez as a result of spotty connectivity.
