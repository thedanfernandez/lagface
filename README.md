# Lag Face - The Game

"Lag Face" is an informal game played during online video conferences, using tools such as Zoom, Teams, Meet, or Skype, where attendees attempt to stay perfectly still and quiet to give the impression to new attendees joining the meeting that their video is laggy, frozen, or unresponsive. "I see you... do you see me? I think my video is frozen as you all aren't moving..."

## Winning at Lag Face

The last person to stay perfectly still is declared the winner. If one moves or makes a sound, they are "out". See full rules below.

## Lag Face rules 

### Starting the game

You can start Lag Face in three ways:

1. **From the start**: At the beginning of the meeting by joining the meeting and freezing in place. New meeting attendees get 1-2 seconds to realize "Lag Face" is being played and freeze in place for the next attendee.
2. **In the middle of a call**: As new attendees join the call (for example, joining 10 minutes after the meeting started), all attendees can again freeze in place to start a new round of Lag Face. 
3. **By declaring the game**: During a lul in a meeting, one can declare "LAG FACE!" Once this happens, all other attendees must instantly freeze in place. 

### Movement 

If a participant moves any part of their on-screen body (for example, head or hands) or talks, laughs, or coughs, they are considered "out". Tapping their foot, if it's not shown on the screen, is acceptable. 

### Environment 

Environmental motion or sound is acceptable. If there is background sound, a family member walks by, or a pet comes to say "hi" or get in the way of the participant's camera, they are still considered to be in the game, unless they move or make sound. 

### Blinking

Blinking is allowed by default. An *optional* rule for experienced Lag Face players is to **not** allow blinking, which turns Lag Face into a staring contest. 

## Who created Lag Face?

Lag Face started organically during online video meetings with Brian Peek, Clint Rutkas, and Dan Fernandez, as a result of spotty connectivity.
